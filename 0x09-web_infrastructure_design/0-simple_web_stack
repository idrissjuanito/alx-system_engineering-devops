1. A Server is a Hardware or software application in a datacenter and handles requests link to the application it serves
2. The role of a domain name is to provide a human friendly name for reaching a server that is tied to an ip address
3. The role of a webserver is to handle http request and send back a response to the client
4. www is a CNAME DNS Record
5. An application server provides business logic for request that require dynamic computing
6. A database stores persistent data of the application
7. The server communicates with the user through a network mostly the internet

The server here is the single point of failure because there is no backup server and if this one goes down the whole application
becomes inaccessible
If the server gets overwhelmed by traffic the are no scaling options meaning the application
becomes inacessible and same goes for maintenance.
