Firewalls are hardware or software security layers than control access to a network by outer networks
A firewall is added on a web infrastructure to secure the servers from unauthorized access

Traffic is served over https so that it can be encrypted and secured from cyber attacks

Monitoring is used for traffic metrics on the server like traffic (number of users), Resources usage like
RAM, bandwith

Monitoring tool collects data by tracking all activities and events that occur on the server and this is done through triggers.

Terminating ssl at load balancing level is an issue because data becomes exposed and any intrusion on the servers
will expose sensitive information.
