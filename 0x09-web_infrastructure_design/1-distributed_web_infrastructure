- This is a distributed web infrastructure with two servers.
_ One of the servers can serve as a backup in case the other one goes down
- having two servers also mean traffic can be distributed between them
- The load balancer can be configured using the Round Robin load balancing algorithm where
user request are equaly distributed between all available servers, ie: first user goes to server 1
and second user goes to server 2
- Active-Active load balancing permits all server to handle request concurently
meaning traffic is distributed between servers
- Active-passive load balancing reserves one or some of the servers as backup that only kick off when
an active server becomes unavailable
- Database primary-replica clusters operate with one serving the whole application and the other dormant
for recovery if the primary db gets damaged or becomes unavaible

- The load balalancer is the single point of failure here because it is the uniq entry point
to the application and has no replica

– The server is not protected by firewall or https communications meanning messages are not encrypted
and can be easily read by any one who can intercept the traffic.
– Firewall rules could protect the server from unathourized access to ports that should not be public
– Monitoring should be enabled for prompt alerts if traffic is broken at any point in the process
